Collaborative participation in the development of a survey system for **Metropolitan Touring**. The system allowed the company's customers to complete satisfaction surveys, as well as request customer service tickets. Work primarily focused on various Frontend screens of the system using React/Typescript with proprietary libraries such as **Syncfusion Data Grid** and **KendoReact by Telerik**. Together with [jlgranda.com](http://jlgranda.com), we managed to optimize the performance of the already overloaded application and unified criteria for handling OData (Open Data Protocol) requests and their impact on rendering. Without a doubt, this is the largest codebase project I have been involved in to date, and the one that has taught me the most about teamwork, the importance of documentation, and coding standards.
